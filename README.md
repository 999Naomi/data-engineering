# Purpose

Sparkify is a startup that recently pushed out a brand-new online music streaming appã€‚ The app collects data about songs and user activity and stores them in the format of JSON, in different directories.

The analytics team is particularly interested in the data and wants to better understand what songs the users are listening to, aiming at providing more valued-added services. As data engineers, we must design a suitable database schema and ETL pipeline. By extracting, transforming, and loading from JSON files into relational models. We provide conveniences for the team to analyze user behaviors.

# Design

The raw data are divided into two categories: log data and music data. **Log data** is about user activities, it contains information about the users, such as name, gender, and location; about the songs, such as artist, song name, and length; and the session, such as session ID, method, and user agent.**Music data** is metadata about songs, such as the location, latitude, longitude, title, year, and duration of the songs. We load the data from S3 into Spark, and then wrangling the data into one fact table and several dimension tables, and then write them back into S3 as parquet files partitioned if necessary.

## Fact

From this point, we can construct our data model as a star schema. A fact table is built based on the log data containing these fields:

1. songplay_id
2. start_time
3. user_id
4. level
5. song_id
6. artist_id
7. session_id
8. location
9. user_agent

## Dimension

We set up four dimensions for the fact table: by user, by song, by artists and by time.

### User Dimension

1. user_id
2. first_name
3. last_name
4. gender
5. Level

### Song Dimension

1. song_id
2. title
3. artist_id
4. year
5. duration

### Artist Dimension

1. artist_id
2. name
3. location
4. latitude
5. longitude

### Time Dimension

1. start_time
2. hour
3. day
4. week
5. month
6. year
7. weekday
